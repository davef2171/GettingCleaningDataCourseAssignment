Step 1.

In the original analysis the data was separated into two a test dataset and a training dataset. No specific different processing was performed on the two data sets so this project starts by recombining them back in to the 
original complete dataset. The Subject identifiers and Activity identifiers were re-added and the two sets combined.

Step 2
Based on the original authors field description and naming convention only any field which has a type descriptor starting with the word "mean" or "std" denoting a mean or standard deviation was extracted into a subset of 
the data along with the corresponding Subject identifier and Activity identifiers.

Step 3.
The using the original notes field names had abbreviations expanded into readable formats.
 a) Using the supplied Activity identifier to name file the Activities were replaced by the equivalent readable names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
 b) The following column name abbreviations were replaced by a more readable term
    the starting letter "t" by "Time."
    the starting letter "f" by "Freq."
    "Freq by ,"Frequency"
    "Acc" by "Accelerometer"
    "Gyro" by "Gyroscope"

Step 4.
The subset of Subject, Activities by name and the subset of mean and standard deviation data was assembled into a complete dataset.

Step 5
The analysis collapsed the data to provide a mean for each of the remaining data variables summarized by Subject and Activity pairs. 

Final Output.
This collapsed the original measurements to a table of 180 entries representing activities(6), one entry per test subject (30).

For each record the following is provided:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment - an integer in the range 1 - 30.
- Its activity label a text description - one of "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING".
- A 79-feature vector with the mean of the extracted original mean and std variables bounded within [-1,1]
  Each mean is a mean over the data records having the same Subject identifier and Activtity identifier and Measurement Type.
  The Column name had the word Mean prefixed to it to distinguish it from the original data records e.g "Time.BodyAccelerometer-mean()-X" became "Mean.Time.BodyAccelerometer-mean()-X"
  The full list of time and frequency domain variables is contain in the file 'summary_fields.txt'
  The defintion of the derivation values whose mean is given is defined in the original dataset file 'features_info.txt'
